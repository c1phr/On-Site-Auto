                <p class="main_text">Excellent - Larry 4/16/2012</p>
                	<p class="main_text_sm">  I thank you so much for coming out and repairing my motor home, your service was great and quick.  Will be telling all my friends.</p>
                <p class="main_text">Highly Recommended! - Mark 7/15/2011</p>
                	<p class="main_text_sm">   I would highly recommend On Site for any automotive task! I have been in the service business for almost fifteen years as service plumber. I do most of my own mechanical work on my truck. Well when trying to install a alternator on my diesel truck I was unable to get the serpentine belt back on. At this point i'm stuck in my driveway thinking dam now i gota get a tow and pay someone to finish the job! Well I googled for a mobile mechanic "lots of choices" I called about four different companies and left messages with all mind you this is late on a sunday night. Onsite responded first and i was very pleased with the service over the phone and on site with Harold the owner. His professional manner and skills were very impressive! He has everything you could need in that trailer!!! Highly recommend using On Site and glad i did! Why take your car or truck to the dealer or small shop and wait around when you can be home and get it fixed for the same price or less!!    Thanks again!        Mark in Peoria AZ</p>
				<p class="main_text">Great Diagnostics. Thank you! - Craig 12/22/2010</p>
					<p class="main_text_sm">If your vehicle has died there's no need to pay a tow truck to take your vehicle in for repair, they come to you. In the auto repair bussiness its hard to find honest and trustworthy people to work on your vechicle. He did an outstanding job at diagnosing exactly what the problem was, instead of replacing a lot of parts which cost money he just replced the one part i needed in a very timely and professional manner.</p>
				<p class="main_text">Great Service - Asher 08/20/2009</p>
					<p class="main_text_sm">On-site just came out to fix an electrical start-up problem. The service from the first phone call start to when the car started was one hundred percent professional. The quote was accurate and understandable, and he made sure to pinpoint the problem before beginning work. He was able to complete the entire job in the parking lot of my apartment building, leaving only to acquire the necessary parts. I give my full recommendation for anyone in need of a quality fix.</p>
				<p class="main_text">Very convenient for disabled drivers! - Stan 07/27/2009</p>
					<p class="main_text_sm">As a disabled individual who is confined to a wheelchair, I always dread the days that I have to take my van into the shop for repairs. Nothing worse than spending half the day sitting in the lobby of a dealership reading two year old magazines while watching a TV tuned to a channel that you have no interest in. I began using On-Site-Auto Repair about three years ago. What a convenience to be able too stay in your home while having your vehicle repaired. Harold is a great mechanic and his prices are very competitive. Two thumbs up from this customer!!</p>
				<p class="main_text">A pleausre to do business with! - Becky 07/24/2009</p>
					<p class="main_text_sm">I used to worry about paying for auto repairs that I did not need, but I stopped worrying in 2007 when I started using On Site. The service I receive is ALWAYS, courteous, timely and professional. It is an extra bonus for me to be able to go about my business at home while the work is being done!</p>
				<p class="main_text">Honest and on Time - TATO 03/11/2009</p>
					<p class="main_text_sm">We have used On Site Auto Repair for years for our fleet of trucks. I can recommend On Site Auto Repair for every job large or small.They have always been right on the money with there diagnostics and repairs. There appearance and investment in training and equipment really reflects a professional level of customer satisfaction not to be rivaled.</p>
